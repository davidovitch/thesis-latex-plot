thesis-latex-plot
=================

This repository is intended to hold a generic example to a PhD thesis setup with the LaTeX Memoir class and some Matplotlib plotting examples. The current state of the repository only holds a near literal copy of my own thesis layout, and I belive it currently only works with LaTeX and not PDFLaTeX.
